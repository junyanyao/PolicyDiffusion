Getting the Year of T21
```{r}

write.csv(MACTownHealth21_v5, "../../Data/MACTownHealth21_v5.csv")


#Don't run
attach(MACTownHealth21)
#Data needs to be fixed and cleaned or we need to crawl a more updated site
max(T21year, na.rm = TRUE)
min(T21year, na.rm = TRUE)

```
###Don't run####

Expand the data to get into Event History Analysis Form
```{r}
pdata <- with(MACTownHealth21_v3, expand.grid(T21year = seq(min(T21year, na.rm = TRUE), max(T21year, na.rm = TRUE)),id = unique(Name)))
